# This repo contains python codes that i have created for work purposes, mainly to automate the process of data entry/data manipulation. As the actual codes and information fields are classified, the scripts provided here are slightly simplified and rid of sensitive information.
# The ReportProcessor.py automatically processes XML output from reports, archives into folders, cleans and input metadata from XML into SQL databases for further analysis
# The TimeVolumetric.py scripts automatically searches for timestamps provided in the report and consolidates the time of report, before importing into SQL database
